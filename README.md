DocumentManager is a simple Flask project to which manages your document.

### Tech

DocumentManger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Python] - High level language for software development
* [Flask] - Flask is a microframework for Python based on Werkzeug, Jinja 2 and good intentions.
* [MongoDB] - MongoDB is an open-source document database that provides high performance, high availability, and automatic scaling.
* [Twitter-Bootstrap] - Bootstrap is an open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS.

And of course DocumentManager itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

### Installation

DocumentManager requires Python3.x to run

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.
